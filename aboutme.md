## About Me

mabuhay po ~ *<a href="https://youtu.be/BwqSraJpqfs" target="_blank">today is a gift.</a>*

hello, my name is Yves De Jesus. welcome to my site where i showcase my data work and side interests. i have extensive experience working with all types of structured _and_ unstructured data (with a focus on GIS data), some of which you can view here in the <a href="/projects.md"> projects </a> section. 


currently, i work at blue cross blue shield. my previous role at a <a href="https://careshq.org/about/" target="_blank">GIS research center</a> involved interacting with the ESRI suite to analyze and map spatial data, among many things between. my background is in journalism, which is how i first broke through the data universe (data-verse?).

below is a (working) collection of wisdom from books, people, the internet, and other media that continue to fuel my creativity to this day üß†

- growth
  - "self-improvement industrial complex: the mistake of seeing life as a project, despite it being something you can‚Äôt solve or get out of. trying to ‚Äújump over your own shadow.‚Äù framing development as ‚Äúfixing yourself‚Äù instead of growth." ‚Äìfrank chimero, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/burnout-list/" target="_blank">_burnout list_</a>
  - "and yet emotional maturity is not something that happens unto us as a passive function of time. it is ... the product of intentional character-sculpting, the slow and systematic chiseling away of our childish impulses for tantrums, for sulking, for instant self-gratification without regard for others, for weaponizing our feelings of shame, frustration, and loneliness." ‚Äìmaria popova, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/11/25/the-school-of-life-book/" target="_blank">_existential maturity and emotional intelligence_</a>
- writing process
  - "simplicity is true wisdom." ‚Äìalain de botton
  - "pay attention to structure, and learn how to report well; remember that most writing problems are actually structuring problems, and most structuring problems are actually reporting problems." ‚Äìed yong, <a href="https://edyong.me/new-page" target="_blank">_journalism advice_</a>
  - "if you want to be a better writer but, like me, you know you're not actually great at it, i suggest you try iterating a short piece of work, over and over [and over and over]." ‚Äìcgp grey, <a href="https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/iteration" target="_blank">_iteration_</a>
  - "always demand a deadline. a deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. it prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. different is better." ‚Äìkevin kelly, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/" target="_blank">_68 unsolicited advice_</a>
- failure
  - "you must never give into despair. allow yourself to slip down that road, and you surrender to your lowest instincts. in the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. that is the meaning of inner strength." ‚Äìuncle iroh, <a href="https://youtu.be/63yn8aCxO84" target="_blank">_avatar: the last airbender_</a>
