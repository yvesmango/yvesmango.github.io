## About Me

mabuhay! <a href="https://youtu.be/BwqSraJpqfs" target="_blank">today is a gift.</a>


my interests lie at the intersection of network analysis and transportation planning; combining network analysis, geospatial analytics, and storytelling to engage urban transit issues through a data science lens. i‚Äôve taken on several technical roles in a wide variety of settings, which involved but not limited to research analysis, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. i‚Äôm infinitely curious about the way the world works; data is my tool for storytelling and understanding the world. what tool do you use?

below is a (working) collection of wisdom from books, people, the internet, and other media that continue to fuel my creativity to this day üß†

- growth
  - "self-improvement industrial complex: the mistake of seeing life as a project, despite it being something you can‚Äôt solve or get out of. trying to ‚Äújump over your own shadow.‚Äù framing development as ‚Äúfixing yourself‚Äù instead of growth." ‚Äìfrank chimero, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/burnout-list/" target="_blank">_burnout list_</a>
  - "and yet emotional maturity is not something that happens unto us as a passive function of time. it is ... the product of intentional character-sculpting, the slow and systematic chiseling away of our childish impulses for tantrums, for sulking, for instant self-gratification without regard for others, for weaponizing our feelings of shame, frustration, and loneliness." ‚Äìmaria popova, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/11/25/the-school-of-life-book/" target="_blank">_existential maturity and emotional intelligence_</a>
- writing process
  - "simplicity is true wisdom." ‚Äìalain de botton
  - "pay attention to structure, and learn how to report well; remember that most writing problems are actually structuring problems, and most structuring problems are actually reporting problems." ‚Äìed yong, <a href="https://edyong.me/new-page" target="_blank">_journalism advice_</a>
  - "if you want to be a better writer but, like me, you know you're not actually great at it, i suggest you try iterating a short piece of work, over and over [and over and over]." ‚Äìcgp grey, <a href="https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/iteration" target="_blank">_iteration_</a>
  - "always demand a deadline. a deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. it prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. different is better." ‚Äìkevin kelly, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/" target="_blank">_68 unsolicited advice_</a>
- failure
  - "you must never give into despair. allow yourself to slip down that road, and you surrender to your lowest instincts. in the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. that is the meaning of inner strength." ‚Äìuncle iroh, <a href="https://youtu.be/63yn8aCxO84" target="_blank">_avatar: the last airbender_</a>
