## Bio, briefly


i am a data-solver â€” i build solutions through data and code, from analysis to dashboards, and even pipelines. i thrive at the intersection of storytelling and data science, putting together disparate pieces into one coherent engine. driven by an endless curiosity about the world, i use data to uncover insights and narrate the stories they tell. what's your tool for understanding the world?
