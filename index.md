## Bio, briefly

hello, my name is Yves De Jesus. i am currently studying data science at the University of Missouriâ€“Columbia, with research pursuits in geospatial analysis. i am currently conducting my research thesis on news desertification from a geospatial lens, together with the joint effort of the data & informatics department and the journalism school. in my off-studies, i work with GIS data as a research analyst at <a href="https://careshq.org/about/" target="_blank">CARES</a>. my background is in journalism, which is how i first broke through the data universe (data-verse?).
