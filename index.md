## Bio, briefly


hello, my name is Yves De Jesus. i am a puzzle-solver at heart, turning data into compelling stories through code. I thrive at the intersection of storytelling and data science. Driven by an endless curiosity about the world, I use data to uncover insights and narrate the stories they tell. What's your tool for understanding the world?
